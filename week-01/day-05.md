### Advanced Python Skills Mastered
```python
# Functions - code organization
def scan_port(target, port):
    return result

# Error handling - professional programming  
try:
    risky_operation()
except Exception as error:
    handle_error(error)

# Libraries - leveraging existing tools
import socket   # Network programming
import sys      # System operations  
import datetime # Timestamps

# Input validation - security essential.

def validate_ip(ip_address):
    # Check IP format before using
