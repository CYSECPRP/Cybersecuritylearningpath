🌐 Network Security Skills
Wireshark Analysis Mastery

Successfully captured and analyzed HTTP vs HTTPS traffic
Mastered TCP, UDP, HTTP, HTTPS, DNS analysis
Applied capture filters for focused analysis
Identified plain text vs encrypted communications

Key Network Discoveries

HTTP traffic: Data visible in plain text (security risk!)
HTTPS traffic: Encrypted data, only metadata visible
DNS queries: Often unencrypted, revealing browsing habits
Port patterns: Standard ports vs custom configurations

🔐 OverTheWire Bandit Progress
Levels Completed Today: 17-20 ✅ (Total: 20 levels)

Level 17: File comparison with diff command
Level 18: SSH command execution without interactive session
Level 19: Setuid binary exploitation for privilege escalation
Level 20: Network communication with netcat

Advanced Commands Learned
bashdiff passwords.old passwords.new    # File comparison
ssh host "cat file"                # Remote command execution
./setuid_binary command            # Privilege escalation
nc -l -p port                     # Network listener
echo "data" | nc host port        # Network data transmission
🌐 TryHackMe Progress
Network Services Room Completed ✅

SMB/SAMBA file sharing security analysis
Telnet unencrypted protocol vulnerabilities
